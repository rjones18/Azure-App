# Azure-App-Service-Python-App

In this project, I have adeptly utilized a suite of Azure services to engineer and deploy a blog website on Azure App Service. The website is built using Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Azure App Service's serverless architecture allows us to host it without managing any infrastructure. For optimal content delivery and user experience, I integrated Azure's Content Delivery Network, which guarantees swift and reliable performance to users worldwide. The critical aspect of security has been addressed by tying Snyk with our Github repository, enabling continuous vulnerability scanning and security loophole detection.

To streamline and secure the deployment process, I leveraged Azure DevOps Pipelines and service principals. These automation tools not only accelerate the deployment process but also safeguard it by reducing human error and securely handling Azure authentication. Furthermore, to add a personal touch to our CDN, I utilized Azure DNS Zone. This facilitated retrieving DNS records directly from my existing Go Daddy DNS, providing our CDN with a custom domain name. The result is a secure, scalable, and efficient blog platform that is delivered fast to a global audience
